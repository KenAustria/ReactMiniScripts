This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Mini Scripts

Each mini script focuses on one relative topic, which is described as the file's name.<br>
Rename the file `index.js` and move the file to the same level as `index.css`.<br>
Then run `npm start` to run in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
